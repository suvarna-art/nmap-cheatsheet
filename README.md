## Overview

This project is a comprehensive **Cyber Lab Environment Guide**, documenting my experience setting up, optimizing, and troubleshooting virtual machines inside **VMware Workstation** for cybersecurity learning and SOC/Blue-Team workflows.

It includes:

- VM optimization best practices  
- Troubleshooting common VMware issues  
- Cisco Packet Tracer usage guide inside Windows Server  
- Network and performance stability guidelines  
- Memory allocation strategies  
- Lab management workflows  

This project is based on my curated *Cyber Security Labs Cheatsheet* and is part of my active cybersecurity portfolio.
