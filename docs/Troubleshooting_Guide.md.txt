# Cyber Lab Troubleshooting Guide (VMware Workstation)

This guide provides solutions to common issues encountered while working with cybersecurity labs on **VMware Workstation / VMware Workstation Pro**, including Windows Server, Kali Linux, and other lab VMs.

## 1. VM Freezing, Lagging, or Slow Response

### Symptoms
- VM takes long to load  
- Mouse/keyboard lag  
- Applications respond slowly  
- Desktop icons delayed

### Causes
- Insufficient RAM or CPU  
- Windows services loading  
- Running multiple active VMs  
- Background tasks on host OS  

### Fix
- Increase RAM (recommended values below)  
- Allocate 2 CPU cores to the VM  
- Close unnecessary apps on host machine  
- Disable startup apps inside the VM  
- Wait 1–2 minutes on first boot

## 2. VM Reconnection Issues / Black Screen

### Symptoms
- VM screen freezes  
- Sound/keyboard unresponsive  
- “(Not responding)” on VMware title bar  

### Fix
- Switch to **Full Screen Mode**  
  - 'VM → Enter Full Screen'
- Disable “**Stretch Guest**” under Display settings  
- Restart graphics acceleration:
  - 'VM → Settings → Display → Accelerate 3D Graphics'
- Refresh display with:
  - **Ctrl + Alt** (release input)

## 3. Cut/Copy/Paste Not Working (Shared Clipboard Off)

VMware sometimes blocks clipboard sharing between host and VM.

### Fix Options
#### 1. Enable Clipboard Sharing
VM -> Settings -> Optons -> Guest Isolation
       - Enable Copy and Paste
       - Enable Drag and Drop


#### 2. If still not working  
Use a workaround site like **dontpad.com**:
1. Paste text on host  
2. Open same URL inside VM  
3. Copy from inside VM

## 4. Internet/Network Connectivity Issues

### Fix Checklist
- Set Adapter to **NAT mode** 
VM → Settings → Network Adapter → NAT

- If using Bridged mode:
- Ensure host network allows bridging
- Reset the VM’s network adapter:
Control Panel → Network → Adapter Settings → Disable / Enable

- Reboot the VM after changes

** VMware Performance Best Practices

✔ Keep at least **2–4 GB free RAM** for your host OS  
✔ Allocate **2 CPU cores** (not all cores)  
✔ Use **SSD** instead of HDD  
✔ Avoid running more than 2 heavy VMs at once  
✔ Disable unnecessary services inside Windows Server
